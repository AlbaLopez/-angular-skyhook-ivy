   * drag source so it's important to pick the minimal data they need to know.
   * You may be tempted to put a reference to the component into it, but you
   * should try very hard to avoid doing this because it couples the drag
   * sources and drop targets. It's a good idea to return something like `{ id:
   * this.id }` from this method.

   *  across the lists in a Kanban board, you want it to retain the dragged
   *  appearanceâ€”even though technically, the component gets unmounted and

   * you do change your component inside this callback, it may not appear
   * immediately, and if you use `zone.run()` then you may experience
   * performance degradation..
