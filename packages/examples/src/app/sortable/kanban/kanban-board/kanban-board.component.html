<!--
    This is the 'sugared' version.
    Use skyhook-card-list, and give it a template for how to
    render each element. It will handle creating the `*ngFor`
    for you, from the list the spec provides, and will help
    you pass context down to [cardRenderer].
--->

<skyhook-card-list class="kanban-root"
    [cardListId]="888"
    [cardListType]="ItemTypes.LIST"
    [cardListSpec]="boardSpec"
    [cardListHorizontal]="true">
    <!-- 'cardListHorizontal' makes the hover behave differently. You need CSS to complete the job.
        It .kanban-root must still like a block element, so no collapsing floats.
        Flexbox/CSS Grid are great. -->

    <!-- The skyhook-card-list component stamps out one cardTemplate
         for each item in yourSpec.getList(). -->
    <ng-template cardTemplate let-context>
        <!-- context is everything the cardRenderer needs to do its job.
             It includes 'data' and 'index', which are just from an *ngFor of your spec's getList(). -->
        <kanban-list
            [cardRenderer]="context"
            [list]="context.data"
            [spec]="listSpec"
            (addCard)="addCard(context.data.id, $event)">

            <!-- is this kanban-list draggable? NOT YET.

                -   because cardRenderer doesn't know which DOM element should be
                    draggable (maybe you want a drag handle), it lets us decide by
                    giving us `render.source`, a DragSource object that is already
                    configured. You are responsible for connecting it to the DOM.
                    If you weren't using child components, you might just do:

                    <div class="each-child"
                        [cardRenderer]="context"
                        #render="cardRenderer"
                        [dragSource]="render.source"></div>

                -   you can either get the directive using `#render="cardRenderer"`,
                    or inject CardRendererDirective<KanbanList> into KanbanListComponent.

                -   we did the latter here, because we want a 'drag handle' inside kanban-list.
                    the other way is demonstrated with the list of cards inside kanban-list.
            -->

        </kanban-list>
    </ng-template>
