        This example uses a generic sortable (not yet released) that produces drop events that include the originating and destination list ids.
        There are two kinds of sortable in play here:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>One
            <span class="span span--darkblue">horizontal</span> one, whose 'cards' are the vertical lists. Try grabbing a whole list by its header, and reordering.</li>
        <li>Many
            <span class="span span--light">vertical</span> ones, which contain the kanban cards. Try moving the cards between lists.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The data behind the board uses <code>@ngrx/store</code>, but this is not necessary.
        Most sorting behaviours are customizable through the <code>SortableSpec</code> interface, which is
        roughly similar to a combination of <code>DragSource & DropTarget</code>, with some key differences:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>hover events are called only when a reorder is necessary; and</li>
        <li>the directives already consume most of the necessary <code>*Monitor</code> information,
            so you are given mostly dragged items for simplicity.</li>
    </ul>
