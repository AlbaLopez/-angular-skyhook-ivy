        This is the 'desugared' style, where you render an *ngFor explicitly.
        It's useful for integrating with other libraries like Material,
        hopefully. Other libraries love to include *ngFor themselves, but it
        should be clear you can attach `cardList` to whatever element you want,
        and then `cardRenderer` to any of its children, even if they are not
        direct children or if some other library only lets you change the item
        template. You can even put a header element inside.

        Do not use both `skyhook-card-list` AND `cardList` -- you will get
        double drop events!
